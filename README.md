## 🧰 Get Started

To get this project up and running in your development environment, follow these step-by-step instructions.

### 📋 Prerequisites

In order to install and run this project locally, you would need to have the following installed on your local machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### ⚙️ Installation and Run Locally

**Step 0:**

Note :bangbang: the application uses Appwrite for Authentication and User Management, therefore, you need to create Appwrite account [here](https://appwrite.io/) and sets the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL` environment variables in `.env` file.

Also,

- you need to create a new storage in Appwrite called `media` and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID` environment variable in `.env` file.
- you need to create a new database in Appwrite and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` environment variable in `.env` file.
- within the database, you need to create those collections: `posts`, `users`, and `saves` and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_{NAME}_COLLECTION_ID` environment variable in `.env` file.

_(the storage and database design can be found in [Reference](#-reference))_

**Step 1:**

Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ladunjexa/nextjs14-snapshot.git
```

**Step 2:**

Execute the following command in the root directory of the downloaded repo in order to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3:**

Execute the following command in order to run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 4:**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 📜 Scripts

All scripts are defined in the `package.json` file. Here is a list of all scripts:

| Script          | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
| `npm run start` | Start your production site locally          |
| `npm run lint`  | Run ESLint                                  |

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Environment variables[^7] can be used for configuration. They must be set before running the app.

> [Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) are variables that are set in the operating system or shell, typically used to configure programs.

**SnapShot** uses [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) as external service. You need to create an account on Appwrite and get the required credentials to run the app.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=653c2da6c1d5708d9509
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_STORAGE_ID=653d6a15d13cd335e1ed
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=653d6a396bd94069ccfd

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID=654816575da94a74d7d2
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_POST_COLLECTION_ID=654816abde7d349f3449
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_SAVES_COLLECTION_ID=654816d94d587ea44bbd
```
